  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>My name is Clark Brading and I’m a technologist. I went to Georgia Tech, graduating as a Biomedical Engineer, and
    joined a startup technology company called 86Borders shortly thereafter. While at 86Borders, I gained the title of
    Director of User Experience and have been the product manager for our main platform (a PAAS solution), our marketing
    pages, and our logistics solution 86EnRoute.</p>

  <p>During my time at 86Borders, I’ve advanced our products by taking requirements from our clients and stakeholders
    and brought them to life through design and work with web and mobile developers (sometimes doing the development
    myself). Seeing these items through to completion also means arming our sales team with screenshots, prototypes, and
    demo videos.</p>

  <p>Apart from my regular job, I’ve also been a board member of the South Eastern Squash Racquets Association (SESRA)
    with the role of Director of Communications for the past year. In this role, I’ve been in charge of overseeing our
    WordPress website, our Constant Contact email outreach newsletters, and our social media profiles.</p>

  <p>I’ve made this website to provide a bit of insight into my world of technology. It functions as a comprehensive
    example of my range of skills, as I design, develop, and support it myself. To see how I made it, check out my GitHub
