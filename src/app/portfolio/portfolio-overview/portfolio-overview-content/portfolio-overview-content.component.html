    <p>The Southeastern Squash Racquets Association (SESRA) was founded in the 1980’s. It functions as a non-profit
      organization to aid the growth of the squash community in the southeast and promote development of junior squash
      players.</p>
    <p>In January 2017 I was invited to join the board as Director of Communications, to revive the website and expand
      community outreach using email programs and social media. Over this time, we’ve consistently added content to the
      website and updated the social media profiles to reflect the SESRA brand; club pros and contributors can log onto
      these profiles to share content.</p>
