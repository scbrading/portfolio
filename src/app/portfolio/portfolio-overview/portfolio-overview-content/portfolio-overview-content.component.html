  <h1>Portfolio</h1>
  <p>In the past several years I’ve worked on several projects. Below is a brief overview of each. If you want to jump
    straight to a project, click on its image or icon.</p>

    <p>I’ve worked at 86Borders for three and a half years and gained the title Director of User Experience. While
      there, I’ve gained extensive experience as a:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Business Analyst</li>
      <li>Product Manager</li>
      <li>Designer</li>
      <li>Developer</li>
      <li>Video Editor</li>
      <li>Strategist</li>
    </ul>

    <p>86Borders is a startup company that has three primary focuses.</p>

    <p>At its core, 86Borders is a social media inspired communications platform, which has a focus on unifying business
      processes that span disparate groups. Individual users can set up personal profiles with photos and other personal
      details; while organizations can set up groups with logos, thumbnails, and banners. The platform hosts
      business-grade applications that use the relationships between groups and individuals to define the workflow.</p>

    <p>The company’s second focus is 86EnRoute, the first product that sprang from the platform. 86EnRoute is a
      logistics solution which offers a mobile app for workers, an operations dashboard for management, and client
      notifications/visibility using text messages with hyperlinks to a real-time tracking application (similar to Uber,
      but without a need to download an app).</p>

    <p>Finally, 86Borders has a healthcare focus. These products, of course, focus on healthcare. The piece that I am
      involved with here, is a translation of 86EnRoute to suit healthcare clients. There are other aspects of
      healthcare which 86Borders is heavily involved, but of which lack the expertise or the forum to speak here.</p>

    <p>The Southeastern Squash Racquets Association (SESRA) was founded in the 1980’s. It functions as a non-profit
      organization to aid the growth of the squash community in the southeast and promote development of junior squash
      players.</p>

    <p>In January 2017 I was invited to join the board as Director of Communications, to revive the website and expand
      community outreach using email programs and social media. Over this time, we’ve consistently added content to the
      website and updated the social media profiles to reflect the SESRA brand; club pros and contributors can log onto
      these profiles to share content.</p>

    <a routerLink="/portfolio/special-projects"><img class="logo" src="../../../../assets/SVG/special_projects_logo.svg"
                                                     alt="special projects logo"></a>

    <p>Aside from work that I’ve done for my job, or as any part of an organization, I’ve felt that I should provide a
      section that covers that special projects that I’ve done. At the moment, that is this website.</p>

    <p>It is not without serious consideration or any small effort that this website is made. Because it is public to
      all viewers and highlights my skills and aptitude as a career technologist, it needs to be sufficiently
      professional. Which - to me - means that it must reflect at least a minimum level of quality that would be
      expected by others in a professional.</p>

    <p>To this end, I decided to make this website as an example of the process I describe in the article that I wrote
      for the <a routerLink="/home">home</a> page, going from idea to production. And true to form, going from the
      original idea of making a website portfolio of past projects to the final product, has taken more time than I had
      hoped and ended up a little different than I expected.
    </p>

    <p>However, the creation of this website nonetheless exemplifies my knowledge of the process and understanding of
      its requirements.</p>
